# passwordStrengthChecker
This Project is made by HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this Project we can check our strong password by alert message that include small latter, capital latter, symbol, and number. Below the input they show the message i.e. valid password, Uppercase Missing, Lowercase Missing, Number Missing etc. This Project is bit more hard.
